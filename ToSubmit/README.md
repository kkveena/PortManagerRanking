Overview
This three-part exercise is designed to provide an opportunity to identify key investing insights from actual shareholder filings data pulled from the Bombay Stock Exchange. The exercise will focus on the shareholding behavior of three specific investment managers, Amansa, Elara India, and Steadview.
You are provided with four datasets:
• ‘Public Shareholders Data’: this dataset captures the quarter-end shareholding information for investors owning 1% or more of the outstanding shares of a given security at the time of filing – in this case, starting on 12/31/2015 for the three specified investment managers.
• ‘Transactions Data’: this dataset contains a summary of each purchase or sale transaction that met a minimum filing threshold for calendar years 2016 – 2020 (YTD) from the three specified investors.
• ‘Security Pricing Data’: this dataset provides daily pricing data for all securities that were held by at least one of the three investment managers (Amansa, Elara India, and Steadview) during the time period covered above. Note: all daily pricing data is in local currency (INR).
• ‘Benchmark Pricing Data’: this dataset provides daily pricing data for the MSCI India Index over the same time period. Note: all daily pricing data is in local currency (INR).
The first two analyses can be completed using the tools of your choice (for example, Python or R for analysis, Plotly or Tableau for data visualizations).
You will be given three days to complete all three parts of this exercise. After the completion of this exercise you should be prepared to discuss your findings live via a 60 minute Zoom meeting.
Part 1:
Analyze the provided datasets for the three specific investment managers (Amansa, Elara India, and Steadview), and rank order each manager in terms of your assessment of their investment skill. Please specify the criteria and rationale for your ranking and support your ranking with any specific analyses and calculations.
Part 2:
Use the provided datasets to help design a long-only algorithmic equity trading strategy with the objective to outperform the MSCI India Index over as many rolling 6 month periods as possible. Identify and describe at least two trade signals from the shareholder filings data that might be good indicators of future stock performance. Please limit your analysis to the data provided, and do not use any external data.
Part 3:
We understand the data provided is limited, and for more conclusive findings you might want a larger dataset. What data, in addition to what was provided to you, would you ask for if you were planning to spend (a) one more day, (b) one more week, and (c) one more month working on this project full-time? What additional analyses would you perform if you had that data?
